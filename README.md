# Ludo

This program is the AI implementation of the Ludo game, in which instead of it being the four player game, we have consized it to a two player game (depending upon the game mode provided by the server).

The game connects with the server via. client file provided.
The graphics related to the game has also been included in this file.

How to run the code:
1. Copy the file in the folder where the client and server are present.
2. Open the terminal with the same folder as path.
3. Start server as:"server/server <port no>"
4. Start the client as: "client/client <server IP address> <port no> ludo.py <no Board Option>"
